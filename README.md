**Introduction to the Architecture Diagram for "Lolo Cookies" Website**


The architecture diagram for the "Lolo Cookies" website illustrates the end-to-end system design of our online cookie store, specifically focusing on the integration of an "Order via WhatsApp" button. This diagram provides a comprehensive overview of how different components of the system interact to facilitate seamless customer orders and efficient order management.


**Key Components:**
- **User Interface (Front-end)**: Includes the homepage where customers view products, promotions, and a dedicated "Order via WhatsApp" button integrated on product pages and the order form.
- **Back-end Server**: Responsible for processing incoming order data from the user interface and integrating with the WhatsApp API to send order details directly to the storeâ€™s WhatsApp number.
- **Database**: Stores order details, customer information, and order history for tracking and management purposes.
- **WhatsApp Service**: Receives order messages sent through the WhatsApp API and provides a direct line of communication for order processing.


The diagram demonstrates the flow of data from customer interactions on the website to backend processing and communication via WhatsApp, ensuring a smooth and efficient ordering experience for customers and effective order management for the store.
